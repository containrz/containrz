## Notes

`containrz` is a new way to handle your states. It uses classes and a well known `setState` API (same as [React.Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)).

It utilises [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) in order to provide with reactive behaviour when the stored state is updated.
